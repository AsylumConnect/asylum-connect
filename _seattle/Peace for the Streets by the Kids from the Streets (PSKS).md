- **Description:** PSKS supports young adults through various programs that encourage empowerment, intervention, education and community service. PSKS programs are the stepping stone to transition youth from the streets to self-sufficiency. Many of our clients are squatters, have animal companions and/or children, suffering from addiction or have other circumstances that make it tough to find indoor shelter. Most of our youth don’t follow the linear flow of shelter to transitional housing to secure housing. Often they are living under bridges, in cars or tents in the woods until they can secure their own housing. Our approach to basic needs is one of harm reduction–making human safety, health and security a priority whether they are living in an abandoned building or still struggling with substance abuse.
